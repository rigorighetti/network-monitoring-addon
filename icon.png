# Note: This is a placeholder for the add-on icon
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file (128x128 or 256x256)
# The icon should represent network monitoring (e.g., network graph, signal waves, etc.)
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder to indicate where the icon should be placed.
